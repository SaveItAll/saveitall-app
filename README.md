## Why is this app not on Google Play?

Google Play has lots of policies in place that make it difficult to distribute "downloader" apps.
There are a lot of them already, but most of them are by anonymous developers.
For now, you can download the APK directly from this repo. I may upload to Google Play in the future.

## Is this app available on iOS?

The app has been developed in Flutter, so it can be built and run on iOS as well. However similar policies on the App Store are painful to deal with.
I may upload an unsigned IPA in the future that you can side load.

## How to download?

Visit the [releases](https://github.com/SaveItAll/saveitall-app/releases) page and download the latest APK for Android or IPA for iOS.
